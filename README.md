# Flask Text Predictive App
This is a web-based application suggesting words the end user may wish to insert in a text field.

The project includes parts:
1. ***Data Preprocessing and Modeling*** (See the folder **pred_text_prep**)
2. ***Flask Application*** (See the folder **flask_pred_text_app**)

***NOTE***: This reporsitory does not contain the raw data, since the raw data was very large.
To run the first part, you need to have the raw data. Of course, you can use your own data.
